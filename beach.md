# Beach â€” Shelter and Plans

You decide the safest first step is shelter. You gather driftwood and palm fronds and construct a lean-to behind a sand dune. The work makes you sweat, but the shelter looks sturdy enough for a night.

While gathering more materials, you notice footprints leading from the tree line toward a rocky cove. They look recent.

What next?

- [Head into the jungle now that you're protected.](jungle.md)
