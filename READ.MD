# The Island of Secrets

You come to on a sun-bleached beach. Your ship is a tangle of wood and rope half-buried in sand. When you push yourself up, you notice strange carved symbols on nearby trees and hear a deep, slow drumbeat coming from the jungle.

You taste salt and have only a small satchel with a water bottle and a knife. The sky is clear, but the island feelsâ€¦ watching.

What will you do?
