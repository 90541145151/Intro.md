# The Wreck â€” Scavenging

You return to the wreck. Inside a broken crate you find a sealed vial of strange powder and a half-torn map with an X near the center of the island. The map also shows a carved stone marked with the same symbol you saw on the trees.

This feels important.

- [Pocket the vial and head back to the beach to build shelter.](beach.md)
- [Bring the map to the nearby village (you think you saw smoke earlier).](village.md)
